I am a researcher working at the intersection of applied mathematics and mechanical engineering, 
with a focus on mathematical modeling of physical systems.

My research combines analytical modeling, geometry-based methods, and experimental validation, 
and spans topics such as kinematic synthesis of mechanisms, thermal and sensor modeling, 
partial differential equations, and inverse problems in engineering.

This repository hosts my personal academic webpage and provides open-access links to selected 
Author Accepted Manuscripts (AAMs) and related research materials.

## Research Themes

My work can be broadly grouped into the following interconnected research themes:

### 1. Mathematical Modeling of Physical Systems
- Analytical and semi-analytical modeling  
- Governing equations derived from physical principles  
- Validation through experiments and comparison with existing literature  

### 2. Thermal Analysis, Sensors, and Solidification Modeling
- Newtonian and semi-Newtonian thermal analysis  
- Modeling of casting and solidification processes  
- Frequency-based sensing and tuning fork mass sensors  

### 3. Mechanism Analysis, Geometry, and Kinematic Synthesis
- Forward and inverse kinematic analysis of planar mechanisms  
- Algebraic and implicit representations of coupler curves  
- Real-time synthesis of four-bar mechanisms  

### 4. Geometry, Patterns, and Dynamical Systems (Exploratory)
- Algebraic curves and super-ellipses  
- Geometric pattern generation  
- Low-dimensional dynamical system modeling
