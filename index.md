## 1) A Tuning-Fork-Based Multi-Sensor for Simultaneous Real-Time Determination of Surface Mass Density and Young’s Modulus in Thin-Film Coatings

**Venue:** Measurement (2026)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2026.120812](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2026.120812)

### Abstract (official)
Quartz tuning fork (QTF)-based sensors are widely used in thin-film characterization and mass-sensitive applications due to their low cost, high quality factor, and simple structure. However, conventional frequency–mass relations derived from Euler–Bernoulli beam theory often neglect the elastic contribution of deposited films, which leads to significant inaccuracies in practical measurements.
This study introduces a tuning-fork-based multi-sensor framework that enables the simultaneous real-time determination of surface mass density and Young’s modulus in thin-film coatings. A unified analytical model is developed to account for both mass loading and elastic effects, and its predictions are validated through systematic experimental measurements.
The proposed approach allows reliable decoupling of mass and stiffness contributions to frequency shifts and provides accurate estimation of mechanical film properties without requiring independent calibration procedures. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed method significantly improves measurement accuracy compared with classical formulations.
These findings establish the proposed multi-sensor framework as a robust and practical tool for quantitative thin-film characterization and advanced QTF-based sensing applications.

## 2) Approximate Fundamental Frequency Formula for Cantilevers with Weakly Non-uniform Sections and Verification with Experiments and Other Studies in the Literature

**Venue:** Journal of Sound and Vibration (2024)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2024.118813](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2024.118813)
**Open Access (AAM):** [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18504955](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18504955)

### Abstract (official)
Vibrational frequencies of beams with uniform cross-sections can be obtained directly from analytical solutions of the Euler–Bernoulli equation. In contrast, beams with non-uniform cross-sections generally require complex and time-consuming numerical analyses tailored to each specific geometry.  
This study introduces an approximate analytical formula that accurately predicts the fundamental vibrational frequency of cantilever beams with weakly non-uniform cross-sections, independent of how the cross-sectional shape varies along the beam length. The formulation is applicable to a broad class of weak heterogeneities and avoids the need for repeated numerical simulations.  
The proposed formula is experimentally validated and systematically compared with existing results in the literature. It is shown to reliably predict frequency shifts in several practically important cases, including thin heterogeneous film deposition on uniform beams, removal of thin heterogeneous layers, and frequency variation induced by a moving point load. The average absolute percentage error between experimentally measured and predicted frequencies is found to be below 0.17%.  
These results establish the proposed formula as a practical and accurate tool for vibration analysis of weakly heterogeneous beams, with direct relevance to sensing, thin-film characterization, and structural dynamics applications.

## 3) A Novel Equation and Some Surprising Results in Tuning Fork Mass Sensors

**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2025.119377](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2025.119377)

### Abstract (official)
The use of quartz tuning forks (QTFs) as mass sensors in thin-film coating applications relies on frequency–mass relations derived from the Euler–Bernoulli equation. This study provides a combined theoretical and experimental evaluation of the accuracy of these conventional formulations.  
Experiments conducted on tuning forks larger than typical QTFs reveal that classical formulas may produce mass prediction errors of up to 300%. Detailed analysis identifies two dominant sources of error: the neglect of the Young’s modulus contribution of the coating and the implicit assumption of longitudinally homogeneous film deposition.  
To address these limitations, a new analytical model is developed and validated through extensive experiments. The proposed framework predicts both deposited mass and elastic contributions with an error of approximately 1.5%.  
Contrary to conventional assumptions, the results demonstrate—both mathematically and experimentally—that coating-induced frequency shifts may decrease, increase, or remain unchanged, depending on the film’s Young’s modulus and longitudinal uniformity. The proposed model provides a physically consistent explanation for these surprising behaviors and establishes a reliable framework for QTF-based mass sensing in thin-film applications.

## 4) A game-changing equation during the etching of tuning forks and its verification through experiments

**Venue:** Measurement (2024)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2024.115135](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2024.115135)

### Abstract (official)
Quartz tuning fork (QTF) sensors are widely used due to their simplicity, low cost, and high quality factor, and they represent an important alternative to quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors in mass-sensitive applications. However, the physical effects of etching processes on the vibrational behavior of tuning forks have remained insufficiently understood.  
This study presents a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of tuning fork etching dynamics, covering both electro-etching of large-scale tuning forks and low-pressure radio-frequency (RF) plasma etching of quartz tuning forks. Contrary to expectations based on QCM behavior, post-etching measurements reveal a decrease in resonance frequency for both large-scale tuning forks and QTFs relative to their unetched states.  
To explain this unexpected behavior, a novel analytical equation is derived that directly relates the observed frequency reduction to mass loss during etching. The proposed formulation is validated through extensive experimental measurements and is shown to accurately predict frequency shifts across different etching methods and geometries. A key finding of the study is that longitudinal homogeneity of the tuning fork prongs plays a critical role in determining the validity and accuracy of the proposed equation.  
The results introduce a new physical interpretation of tuning fork etching and establish a quantitative framework for frequency–mass relations in QTF systems. This framework enables reliable calibration of etched tuning forks and supports the widespread adoption of low-cost QTFs as mass-sensitive biosensors.

## 5) Breaking Complexity: Kaleidoscopic Tools for Islamic Geometric Pattern Design

**Venue:** Nexus Network Journal (2024/2025)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1007/s00004-025-00814-2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00004-025-00814-2)

### Abstract (official)
The decomposition of Islamic geometric patterns into simpler components through reflection analysis and other methods facilitates their understanding, reproduction, digital processing, and the creation of new variations. Previous studies have focused on the fundamental region, the smallest unit that can be repeated by using specific symmetry operations (translation, rotation, reflection) to form a whole pattern. This study introduces new concepts and proposes a method called the kaleidoscopic imaging method to obtain a smaller unit than the fundamental region.

## 6) Comprehensive analysis and real-time synthesis of four-bar mechanisms via a 10-parameter model and an implicit curve fitting approach

**Venue:** Proc. IMechE Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science (2025)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1177/09544062251361356](https://doi.org/10.1177/09544062251361356)
**Open Access (AAM):** [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18503594](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18503594)

### Abstract (official)
In the kinematic analysis of coupler curves, a nine-parameter parametric formulation dependent on mechanism dimensions is commonly employed. This study extends the classical formulation by introducing a 10th parameter, referred to as the closure parameter, enabling a more complete and flexible representation of four-bar mechanism kinematics.  
A comprehensive, fast, and practical real-time simulation framework is presented, providing continuous visualization of 16 kinematic variables throughout the motion cycle. The simulation accuracy is validated through comparisons with manually constructed mechanisms and is shown to perform reliably across a wide range of four-bar configurations.  
A further contribution of this work is the introduction of the General Coupler Curve Equation Curve Fitting Method (GCCE-CFM), which enables fast and practical kinematic synthesis of coupler curves. The method derives explicit expressions for the 16 coefficients of the sixth-degree General Coupler Curve Equation (GCCE) directly in terms of the mechanism parameters.  
Using real-time implicit curve fitting, 40 points sampled from a target coupler curve are used to recover the underlying mechanism dimensions with high accuracy within a few seconds. The proposed framework achieves a high-precision curve fit with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 6.85 × 10⁻⁵, demonstrating its effectiveness for accurate coupler curve synthesis and real-time mechanism design.

## 7) Determination of Position-dependent Solid Fraction by a New Cooling Curve Analysis Method: Semi-Newtonian Fourier Thermal Analysis

**Venue:** International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer (2021)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2021.105353](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2021.105353)

### Abstract (official)
In this study, a method of cooling curve analysis (CCA) was developed to obtain the solid fraction of the liquid metal as a function of both position and time. Obtaining the solid fraction depending on the location is valuable to see the spatial improvement of solidification and examine the factors affecting it (gravity, heterogeneity, the effect of the mold, etc.). In previous studies using CCA, which is a low-cost method, the solid fraction has been found only depending on time, even if Fourier thermal analysis (FTA) was used. Thus, this method, called semi-Newtonian FTA (SNFTA), is unique in that it uses CCA to calculate the solid fraction as a function of both position and time.
After developing the SNFTA method combining Newton and Fourier heat equations, its accuracy was tested in two ways. The method was applied to pure tin and the thermal diffusivity and latent heat values of the tin were then estimated. It was observed that the predicted diffusivity and latent heat values deviated little from their original values. Therefore, it can be said that the local solid fraction functions obtained by this method were reliable.

### Abstract (official)
This study reports on the development of an alternative model which overcomes the drawbacks of the Newtonian thermal analysis of casting summarized from the literature. The alternative Analytically Solved Solid Fraction Model (AS-SFM) aims to improve the reliability of the measurement of latent heat and solid fraction. The latent heat of pure tin is computed by AS-SFM and the other models in the literature, and the results are compared with the literal value of the latent heat. The new method is shown to be a more reliable latent heat predictor than the other methods given in the literature.

## 9) A new baseline for the Newtonian thermal analysis of casting

### Abstract (official)
Computer-aided cooling curve thermal analysis for the casting process is usually applied to predict the latent heat of transformation and the solid fraction. In this study, one of the important limitations of the Newtonian thermal analysis for the prediction of the latent heat was determined as the disregard of the thermal capacity of mold. Therefore, a new baseline technique, two-capacitive system baseline (TCSBL), was developed by taking the thermal capacity of the mold into account. This new method was modeled by considering the analogy between RC circuits and the metal–mold thermal capacitance system. It was improved by a Taylor series expansion approach to express the cooling rates in terms of the metal and mold temperatures. Ten experiments with four types of pure metals were undertaken to compare the latent heat results of TCSBL with the Newtonian and Dynamic Baselines (NBL and DBL). The mean percentage error for the latent heat prediction of TCSBL, NBL, and DBL were calculated as 4.3, 29, and 24 %, respectively, in comparison with the literal value of the latent heats.
