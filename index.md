## 1) Approximate Fundamental Frequency Formula for Cantilevers with Weakly Non-uniform Sections and Verification with Experiments and Other Studies in the Literature

**Venue:** Journal of Sound and Vibration (2024)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2024.118813](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2024.118813)
**Open Access (AAM):** [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18504955](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18504955)

### Abstract (official)
Vibrational frequencies of beams with uniform cross-sections can be obtained directly from analytical solutions of the Euler–Bernoulli equation. In contrast, beams with non-uniform cross-sections generally require complex and time-consuming numerical analyses tailored to each specific geometry.  
This study introduces an approximate analytical formula that accurately predicts the fundamental vibrational frequency of cantilever beams with weakly non-uniform cross-sections, independent of how the cross-sectional shape varies along the beam length. The formulation is applicable to a broad class of weak heterogeneities and avoids the need for repeated numerical simulations.  
The proposed formula is experimentally validated and systematically compared with existing results in the literature. It is shown to reliably predict frequency shifts in several practically important cases, including thin heterogeneous film deposition on uniform beams, removal of thin heterogeneous layers, and frequency variation induced by a moving point load. The average absolute percentage error between experimentally measured and predicted frequencies is found to be below 0.17%.  
These results establish the proposed formula as a practical and accurate tool for vibration analysis of weakly heterogeneous beams, with direct relevance to sensing, thin-film characterization, and structural dynamics applications.

## 2) A Novel Equation and Some Surprising Results in Tuning Fork Mass Sensors

**Venue:** Journal of Sound and Vibration (2025)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2025.119377](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2025.119377)

### Abstract (official)
The use of quartz tuning forks (QTFs) as mass sensors in thin-film coating applications relies on frequency–mass relations derived from the Euler–Bernoulli equation. This study provides a combined theoretical and experimental evaluation of the accuracy of these conventional formulations.  
Experiments conducted on tuning forks larger than typical QTFs reveal that classical formulas may produce mass prediction errors of up to 300%. Detailed analysis identifies two dominant sources of error: the neglect of the Young’s modulus contribution of the coating and the implicit assumption of longitudinally homogeneous film deposition.  
To address these limitations, a new analytical model is developed and validated through extensive experiments. The proposed framework predicts both deposited mass and elastic contributions with an error of approximately 1.5%.  
Contrary to conventional assumptions, the results demonstrate—both mathematically and experimentally—that coating-induced frequency shifts may decrease, increase, or remain unchanged, depending on the film’s Young’s modulus and longitudinal uniformity. The proposed model provides a physically consistent explanation for these surprising behaviors and establishes a reliable framework for QTF-based mass sensing in thin-film applications.

## 3) A game-changing equation during the etching of tuning forks and its verification through experiments

**Venue:** Measurement (2024)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2024.115135](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2024.115135)

### Abstract (official)
Quartz tuning fork (QTF) sensors are widely used due to their simplicity, low cost, and high quality factor, and they represent an important alternative to quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors in mass-sensitive applications. However, the physical effects of etching processes on the vibrational behavior of tuning forks have remained insufficiently understood.  
This study presents a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of tuning fork etching dynamics, covering both electro-etching of large-scale tuning forks and low-pressure radio-frequency (RF) plasma etching of quartz tuning forks. Contrary to expectations based on QCM behavior, post-etching measurements reveal a decrease in resonance frequency for both large-scale tuning forks and QTFs relative to their unetched states.  
To explain this unexpected behavior, a novel analytical equation is derived that directly relates the observed frequency reduction to mass loss during etching. The proposed formulation is validated through extensive experimental measurements and is shown to accurately predict frequency shifts across different etching methods and geometries. A key finding of the study is that longitudinal homogeneity of the tuning fork prongs plays a critical role in determining the validity and accuracy of the proposed equation.  
The results introduce a new physical interpretation of tuning fork etching and establish a quantitative framework for frequency–mass relations in QTF systems. This framework enables reliable calibration of etched tuning forks and supports the widespread adoption of low-cost QTFs as mass-sensitive biosensors.

## 4) Breaking Complexity: Kaleidoscopic Tools for Islamic Geometric Pattern Design

**Venue:** Nexus Network Journal (2024/2025)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1007/s00004-025-00814-2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00004-025-00814-2)
**Open Access (AAM):** [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18505476](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18505476)

### Abstract (official)
The analysis and reproduction of Islamic Geometric Patterns (IGPs) traditionally rely on the identification of the fundamental region, defined as the smallest area that can reproduce a complete pattern through symmetry operations such as translation, rotation, and reflection. However, determining the fundamental region often requires advanced mathematical knowledge and specialized software, limiting accessibility for designers and researchers.  
This study introduces a new conceptual framework and method, termed the kaleidoscopic imaging method, which decomposes Islamic geometric patterns into units smaller than the classical fundamental region. By systematically applying reflection-based symmetry operations, complex patterns are reduced to a minimal set of two or three line segments, referred to as the visual signature or stamp.  
The proposed method distinguishes between motifs, pseudo-motifs, and stamps, and formalizes a kaleidoscopic operator that enables both pattern analysis and synthesis. The approach is demonstrated using the Desmos Geometry environment, allowing interactive and intuitive exploration without the need for advanced programming or mathematical background.  
Through numerous examples based on square and hexagonal tilings, the study shows that complex Islamic geometric patterns can be reconstructed efficiently from their stamps via kaleidoscopic synthesis. Small modifications at the stamp level generate new pattern variations while preserving the original symmetry structure.  
This work provides a practical and accessible tool for understanding, reproducing, and generating Islamic geometric patterns, bridging the gap between mathematical rigor and design-oriented usability.

## 5) Comprehensive analysis and real-time synthesis of four-bar mechanisms via a 10-parameter model and an implicit curve fitting approach

**Venue:** Proc. IMechE Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science (2025)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1177/09544062251361356](https://doi.org/10.1177/09544062251361356)
**Open Access (AAM):** [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18503594](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18503594)

### Abstract (official)
In the kinematic analysis of coupler curves, a nine-parameter parametric formulation dependent on mechanism dimensions is commonly employed. This study extends the classical formulation by introducing a 10th parameter, referred to as the closure parameter, enabling a more complete and flexible representation of four-bar mechanism kinematics.  
A comprehensive, fast, and practical real-time simulation framework is presented, providing continuous visualization of 16 kinematic variables throughout the motion cycle. The simulation accuracy is validated through comparisons with manually constructed mechanisms and is shown to perform reliably across a wide range of four-bar configurations.  
A further contribution of this work is the introduction of the General Coupler Curve Equation Curve Fitting Method (GCCE-CFM), which enables fast and practical kinematic synthesis of coupler curves. The method derives explicit expressions for the 16 coefficients of the sixth-degree General Coupler Curve Equation (GCCE) directly in terms of the mechanism parameters.  
Using real-time implicit curve fitting, 40 points sampled from a target coupler curve are used to recover the underlying mechanism dimensions with high accuracy within a few seconds. The proposed framework achieves a high-precision curve fit with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 6.85 × 10⁻⁵, demonstrating its effectiveness for accurate coupler curve synthesis and real-time mechanism design.

## 6) Determination of Position-dependent Solid Fraction by a New Cooling Curve Analysis Method: Semi-Newtonian Fourier Thermal Analysis

**Venue:** International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer (2021)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2021.105353](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2021.105353)
**Open Access (AAM):** [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18508764](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18508764)

### Abstract (official)
Conventional cooling curve analysis (CCA) enables the determination of latent heat and solid fraction during solidification; however, existing Newtonian and Fourier-based approaches restrict the solid fraction to a function of time only. This limitation prevents spatial analysis of solidification phenomena, such as the effects of gravity, mold heterogeneity, and position-dependent heat transfer.  
This study introduces Semi-Newtonian Fourier Thermal Analysis (SNFTA), a hybrid framework that combines Newtonian and Fourier heat equations to compute the solid fraction as a function of both position and time using cooling curve data. The method exploits axial heat conduction modeled by Fourier’s law while retaining Newtonian heat transfer in the radial direction, making it compatible with narrow cylindrical molds instrumented with multiple thermocouples.  
The accuracy of SNFTA is validated using pure tin. Thermal diffusivity and latent heat values obtained from the model show only minor deviations from accepted reference values, demonstrating the reliability of the position-dependent solid fraction functions derived by the method.  
These results establish SNFTA as a unique extension of cooling curve analysis, enabling spatially resolved solidification analysis using a low-cost experimental setup.

## 7) Analytically Solved Solid Fraction Model for the Newtonian Thermal Analysis of Casting

**Venue:** Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A (2016)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11661-016-3464-0](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11661-016-3464-0)
**Open Access (PDF):** [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18508852](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18508852)

### Abstract (official)
Newtonian thermal analysis is widely used to estimate latent heat and solid fraction during metal solidification; however, most existing formulations rely on numerical differentiation, baseline assumptions, or empirical corrections that reduce reliability and robustness. These limitations are well documented in the literature and motivate the need for an analytically consistent alternative.  
This study introduces the Analytically Solved Solid Fraction Model (AS-SFM), a closed-form framework that enables direct computation of latent heat and solid fraction without numerical differentiation or heuristic baseline construction. The model is derived analytically and is fully compatible with Newtonian cooling curve analysis.  
The latent heat of pure tin is calculated using AS-SFM and several representative models from the literature, and the results are systematically compared with the accepted reference value. The proposed AS-SFM demonstrates significantly improved accuracy and consistency, establishing it as a more reliable latent heat predictor than existing Newtonian thermal analysis methods.  
These results position AS-SFM as a robust analytical alternative for solid fraction modeling and latent heat determination in casting applications.

## 8) A new baseline for the Newtonian thermal analysis of casting

**Venue:** Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry (2015)  
**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10973-014-4143-2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10973-014-4143-2)

### Abstract (official)
Newtonian cooling curve thermal analysis is widely employed to estimate latent heat and solid fraction during metal solidification. A fundamental limitation of conventional Newtonian baseline formulations is the neglect of the thermal capacity of the mold, an assumption that leads to significant errors when sand molds or high-thermal-mass molds are used.  
This study introduces a two-capacitive system baseline (TCSBL) that explicitly accounts for the coupled thermal capacities of both the metal and the mold. The method models the metal–mold system as a lumped two-capacitance problem using an electrical RC-circuit analogy, and an equivalent Taylor-expanded formulation of cooling rates. The resulting baseline can be directly applied to Newtonian cooling curve analysis without smoothing or differentiation of the experimental temperature data.  
Experimental validation was conducted using four pure metals (Al, Pb, Sn, and Zn). The proposed TCSBL reduces latent heat prediction errors from approximately 25–30% (classical Newtonian and dynamic baselines) to about 4%, demonstrating a substantial improvement in both accuracy and robustness.  
These results establish TCSBL as a new reference baseline for Newtonian thermal analysis of casting, particularly for applications involving molds with non-negligible thermal mass.
