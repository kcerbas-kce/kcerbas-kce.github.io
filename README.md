# K. C. Erbaş — Research Codes, Data, and Reproducible Materials

This repository provides open-access MATLAB codes, datasets, and supplementary materials 
associated with my peer-reviewed publications in applied mathematics, applied physics, 
and interdisciplinary engineering.

The primary focus is on inverse problems, analytical and semi-analytical modeling, 
applied partial differential equations, electrostatics, sensor modeling, 
and geometry-based computational methods.

All materials are shared to support reproducible research and transparent scientific practice.
